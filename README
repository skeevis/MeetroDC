MeetroDC is a Google Android (2.0) application that allows users to look up DC Metro train times.

This can also serve as a learning tool, as it's a pretty basic Android application. Bon appetit.


NOTE: We're not affiliated at all with WMATA.
NOTE: We're also not affiliated with Meetro. But since Meetro is a failed startup, I doubt they would care. Right?

Hopefully forthcoming features:
* Navigable Map
* Nearest Station (via GPS)
* Better display and handling of train times (right now we're just displaying their web page)
* "My Stations" list
